## 🎯 **The Meta-Project: Reverse Engineering with AI**

This repository demonstrates a groundbreaking capability: **reverse engineering complete source code implementations using only abstract research papers and AI interpretation of diagrams**. 

### The True Goal

**Proof of Concept**: Any source code can be originally written by the latest LLM code assistants, provided enough information describing the methodology.

**Achievement**: This was accomplished with an acceptable rate of error as a **"one-shot" solution** for output evaluation purposes.

---

## 🧠 **The Challenge**

Can an AI assistant reverse engineer and implement a complex computer vision system using only:
- ✅ An abstract research paper description
- ✅ Vision-enabled interpretation of embedded diagrams
- ✅ No access to original source code or implementation details
- ✅ No prior knowledge of the specific algorithms

**Answer: YES** ✨

---

## 🚀 **The Original Prompt**

The entire project was initiated with this single prompt to **Claude Sonnet 4**:

> *"I have provided descriptive information 'diagram_notes.md' (see below for file content) for each [diagram1] and [diagram2] as they are presented in the original paper as embedded JPG which you cannot see.*
>
> *read the 'abstract.md' (see below for file content) which explains a novel method for "SVG layer peeling" which aims to deconstruct SVG images by stripping layers away iteratively.*
>
> *We can understand the principle explained in this abstract, then using only that information, we can reconstruct a novel approach based on the concepts detailed here to build towards a fully working version that escapes the need for a stable diffusion model, preferring to only manipulate/edit SVG files or rasterized versions of SVG files, by way of removing layers as described.*
>
> *We will name this project "SVG-Unmask" because masking is used to hide parts of layers. Unmask is the logical and elegant opposite."*

**Tools Used**: Claude Sonnet 4 + VSCode IDE

## 📊 **What Was Achieved**

From just the abstract and diagram descriptions, Claude successfully reverse engineered and implemented:

### Complete System Architecture
- **SVGParser**: Parses SVG structure, calculates bounding boxes, handles complex path data
- **LayerGraph**: Constructs occlusion relationships, identifies topmost layers  
- **PeelingEngine**: Orchestrates autoregressive peeling with configurable termination
- **Interactive CLI**: Full command-line interface with multiple operating modes

### Working Implementation
- ✅ **Autoregressive layer peeling** algorithm
- ✅ **Geometric occlusion detection** without AI dependencies
- ✅ **Semantic element grouping** by visual/spatial relationships
- ✅ **Interactive visualizations** with step-by-step playback
- ✅ **Comprehensive analytics** and performance metrics

### Demonstrated Results
- **Simple Scene**: 7 elements → 5 basic shapes (2 steps)
- **Complex Scene**: 17 elements → 5 fundamental shapes (12 steps)
- **70.6% removal efficiency** with proper layer hierarchy preservation

## 🛠️ **Installation & Usage**

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm package manager

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MushroomFleet/SVG-Unmask.git
cd SVG-Unmask
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Run Examples

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
# Process a simple SVG scene
node src/index.js examples/simple-test.svg

# Process a complex scene with custom settings
node src/index.js examples/complex-scene.svg --max-steps 15 --output results
```

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
# Single step peeling (interactive debugging)
node src/index.js examples/complex-scene.svg --single-step
```

**Advanced Options:**
```bash
# Full option set
node src/index.js <svg-file> [options]

Options:
  --max-steps <n>        Maximum peeling steps (default: 20)
  --output <dir>         Output directory (default: ./output)
  --no-semantic-groups   Disable semantic grouping
  --no-basic-shapes      Don't stop at basic shapes
  --single-step          Interactive single step mode
```

### Step 4: View Results

The system generates:
- **`final.svg`** - Result after complete peeling
- **`step-XX.svg`** - Intermediate states for each step
- **`analysis-report.json`** - Detailed statistics and metadata
- **`visualization.html`** - Interactive viewer with playback controls

Open `visualization.html` in your browser to see the animated peeling process.

## 🔬 **Technical Innovation**

Claude's reverse engineering approach eliminated the original paper's AI dependencies:

| Original Paper | Claude's Implementation |
|---|---|
| Vision-Language Models | Pure geometric analysis |
| Diffusion Models | Direct SVG DOM manipulation |
| ML-based occlusion detection | Mathematical spatial relationships |
| Neural attention control | Deterministic layer identification |

**Key Insight**: The same conceptual goals were achieved through algorithmic approaches rather than machine learning.
